# These ImagePolicies demonstrate how to use the `match` field to select
# container images.
# All examples here assume the Secret and VersioningPolicy from
# `image-policy.yaml` exist.

# This is the default match configuration. If no value is set, Heighliner
# attempts to find tags in the container registry that have the same name
# as any GitHub releases that have passed through the VersioningPolicy.

# This configuration uses label matching. You can match on any number of lables,

# If a match value is the empty object `{}`, it is treated as an identity
# mapping, as in the default value.
